   - Title: "My First Game"
   - Description: "A fun game to play"
   - Category: Select one
   - Game URL: Any HTML5 game URL or use: `https://tbot.xyz/math/`
   - Upload a thumbnail image
4. Click "Publish Game"

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "npm: command not found"
**Solution**: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### Issue: Firebase errors on startup
**Solution**: Make sure you updated `src/services/firebase.ts` with your actual config

### Issue: "Permission denied" when uploading
**Solution**: 
1. Check you set `isAdmin: true` in Firestore
2. Verify Firebase Storage rules are set correctly

### Issue: TypeScript errors in IDE
**Solution**: These are expected until dependencies are installed. Run `npm install`

### Issue: Port 3000 already in use
**Solution**: The app will automatically try port 3001, 3002, etc.

## Testing the Features

### Test Search
1. Go to Home page
2. Use the search bar to search for games
3. Results will filter in real-time

### Test Dark Mode

## Next Steps

1. **Add Real Games**: Upload actual HTML5 games or use embedding URLs

3. **Add More Features**: Extend the codebase as needed
4. **Deploy**: Follow deployment instructions in README.md

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Type checking
npm run tsc
```

## Getting Help

- Check README.md for detailed documentation
- Check Firebase Console for database/auth issues
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages

## Demo Credentials

For testing without Firebase setup, the app includes mock data. However, for full functionality including:
- User authentication
- Game uploads
- Comments
- Persistence

You MUST set up Firebase as described above.
